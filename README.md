# Java Exception Handling
Exception Handling in Java is the process of handling runtime errors so that normal program execution is not interrupted. Java provides a robust mechanism to handle exceptions using try, 
catch, finally, throw, and throws.
## What is an Exception?
An exception is an event that occurs during program execution that disrupts the normal flow. It can be caused by:

1. Invalid user input
2. Network failure
3. File not found
4. Division by zero
5. Accessing an array out of bounds

## Types of Exceptions
Java exceptions are divided into two main types:

**Checked Exceptions** ‚Äì These must be handled at compile time (e.g., IOException, SQLException).
**Unchecked Exceptions** ‚Äì These occur during runtime and do not require explicit handling (e.g., NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException).

# Exception Handling Keywords
Java provides five key mechanisms to handle exceptions:

üîπ**try-catch**
The try block contains code that may throw an exception. The catch block handles it.
```bash
try {
    int result = 10 / 0;  // ArithmeticException
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
    System.out.println("Cannot divide by zero.");
}
```

üîπ**finally**
The finally block always executes, even if an exception occurs.
```bash
try {
    int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3};
    System.out.println(numbers[5]);  // ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
} catch (ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException e) {
    System.out.println("Index is out of bounds.");
} finally {
    System.out.println("This will always execute.");
}
```

üîπ**throw**
The throw keyword is used to explicitly throw an exception.
```bash
public void checkAge(int age) {
    if (age < 18) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Age must be 18 or older.");
    }
}
```

üîπ**throws**
The throws keyword is used in method signatures to indicate exceptions that a method can throw.
```bash
public void readFile() throws IOException {
    FileReader file = new FileReader("data.txt");
}
```

# Common Java Exceptions
Exception -->	Description
ArithmeticException -->	Division by zero error.
NullPointerException -->	Accessing an object that is null.
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException -->	Accessing an invalid array index.
IOException -->	Issues in file handling.
ClassNotFoundException -->	Trying to load a class that doesn't exist.
IllegalArgumentException -->	Passing an invalid argument to a method.

# Best Practices for Exception Handling
‚úÖ Handle exceptions at the right level ‚Äì Don't catch an exception too early if the caller needs to know about it.
‚úÖ Use specific exceptions ‚Äì Avoid catching generic Exception unless necessary.
‚úÖ Log exceptions properly ‚Äì Use e.printStackTrace() or logging frameworks for debugging.
‚úÖ Don't ignore exceptions ‚Äì Always handle or propagate them properly.
‚úÖ Use finally to close resources ‚Äì Example: closing a file or database connection.

# Exercises:
## Beginner - Divide and Conquer
Create a calculator that divides two numbers entered by the user.

* Prompt the user for two integers.
* Handle division by zero using try-catch.
* If the user enters a non-integer value, catch InputMismatchException and ask again.
* Ensure the program doesn‚Äôt crash, no matter what the user enters.
* üìù What you‚Äôll learn: Basic try-catch, handling multiple exceptions.

## Beginner - Array Index Out of Bounds Rescue üöÄ
Create an array of 5 elements and allow the user to retrieve a value based on an index they enter.

* If the user enters an index outside the array bounds, catch ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException and ask for input again.
* Prevent infinite loops when invalid input is given.
* Use a finally block to print: "Operation complete." regardless of success or failure.
* üìù What you‚Äôll learn: Handling ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, using finally blocks.

## Intermediate - Custom Exception: Age Verification üéÇ
Write a program that asks for a user's age and throws a TooYoungException if they are under 18.

* Define a custom exception class TooYoungException.
* If the user enters an invalid age (negative or non-numeric), handle it gracefully.
* If they are above 18, print: "You are old enough!"
* üìù What you‚Äôll learn: Creating custom exceptions, throwing exceptions explicitly.

##  Advanced - Multi-Catch Game: Rolling the Dice üé≤
Simulate a game where a user rolls a virtual dice (random number from 1-6).

* Generate a random number and divide it by another random number to introduce division errors.
* Use a multi-catch block to catch: **ArithmeticException* (if division by zero occurs), *NullPointerException* (simulate by making a null reference).
* Any other exception., print an appropriate message based on which exception occurs.
* üìù What you‚Äôll learn: Multi-catch blocks, catching multiple exceptions in one place.

## Hard - ATM Simulator with Exception Hierarchy üí≥
Create an ATM simulator that supports multiple types of transactions.

Users should be able to:
Withdraw money
Deposit money
Transfer money
Create an exception hierarchy:
InsufficientFundsException (if withdrawal is more than balance).
InvalidAmountException (if deposit or withdrawal is negative).
UnauthorizedAccessException (if a wrong PIN is entered three times).
Implement exception handling in a way that ensures smooth user experience.
üìù What you‚Äôll learn: Designing a proper exception hierarchy, catching & throwing multiple exceptions, structuring real-world exception handling.

## Fun Bonus Exercise:
We‚Äôll simulate document submission using:
‚úÖ Strings for file names instead of actual files.
‚úÖ Integers for file size (MB) instead of real file handling.
‚úÖ Lists for storing case records instead of a database.

You are building a legal case submission system for a law firm. Clients must provide valid details when submitting a case. Your system must handle:

1. Invalid document format ‚Äì Only accept .pdf and .docx. Throw **InvalidFileFormatException** if wrong.
2. Missing documents ‚Äì If no document is submitted, throw **MissingDocumentException**.
3. File size too large ‚Äì If a document is over 50MB, throw **FileTooLargeException**.
4. Invalid age ‚Äì Clients must be at least 18 years old. Throw **UnderageClientException**.
5. Incorrect case number format ‚Äì Must be like LAW-YYYY-XXXX (e.g., LAW-2024-1234).Throw **InvalidCaseNumberException**.
6. Unauthorized case access ‚Äì If a restricted case is accessed, throw **UnauthorizedAccessException**.
